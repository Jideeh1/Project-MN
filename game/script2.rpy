    "He only took items that were random and eccentric{w=0.3}, a fitting reward of living up to his name."
    "They didn't know what his agendas were{w=0.3}, until his hair was gray and his retirement came. {w=0.5}The now former adventurer opened a small tavern, that many of the parties he helped came by."
    "And each of the items he took in every dungeons{w=0.4}, items that were nearly to no value{w=0.2}, items that were uncanny{w=0.3}, was on full display in the tavern."
    "They were said to be his trophies{w=0.3}, but they were probably more than that to the former adventurer.{p}They were invaluable items that served as the nostalgia of their days of adventuring."
    
    "One night, when a couple of young hooligans thought of a good idea to steal his trophies{w=0.5}, broke into the tavern."
    "It would have been a normal case of robbery{w=0.4}, but the adventurer's wife witnessed the crime being done, and protected the tavern from plunderers."
    "Unfortunately{w=0.2}, she was old, even if she was a former adventurer too.{w=0.4} The wife was struck, and the hooligans prepared their bloodied bats{w=0.4}, queuing up to rough up an old lady."
    "But that's when the trophies started moving,{w=0.4} started schreeching.{p}They convulsed{w=0.2}, they deformed.{w=0.3}"
    "Until they finally revealed the true form they were hiding for years.{p}They were mimics."
    "No{w=0.1}, they weren't ordinary mimics.{w=0.3} They were big{w=0.2}, sinsiter{w=0.2}, and very angry mimics.{p}They easily towered over the hoodlums{w=0.3}, aggressively moving forward."
    "It would've been a normal case of robbery{w=0.3}, but the victims got the last laughs instead."
    "The hoodlums weren't adventurers{w=0.3}, they were simple men who did crimes to satiate their cravings."
    "So they weren't up to the task{w=0.4}, and they failed to survive the horde of mimics they brought upon themselves."
    "Among the three hooligans{w=0.3}, there was only one guy who lived to tell the tale{w=0.3}, the one who spread the story.{w=0.4} The hooligan that was supposed to be in the scene{w=0.4}, but came too late as he witnessed the horrifying deaths of his peers."
    "Though even after witnessing the blood-fest of mimicries{w=0.4}, he came back the day later."
    "Obstensively{w=0.2}, the adventurers weren't aware of their possessions being mimicries."
    "But the adventurers who took them in had taken good care of their items for as long as they known.{p}And it just so happen that those mimicries somehow gained a sense of humanity."
    "Witnessing the outside world{w=0.3}, the people whom bonded by simple meals and drinks{w=0.3}, and being taken care of with the highest care."
    "The languages that were probably gibberish to them{w=0.3}, they grew to understand and heard stories beyond them."
    "If you think about it{w=0.3}, it was really no wonder how a simple mimicry gained humanity."
